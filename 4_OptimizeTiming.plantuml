title OptimizeTiming - Signal Timing Optimization

start

:Receive current signal timing plan;
:Receive traffic state metrics;
:Receive energy cost parameters;

:Identify priority approaches\n(queue length, waiting time);

:Adjust green time durations\n(bounded increase/decrease);

:Evaluate need for phase reordering;
if (Switching benefit > switching cost?) then (Yes)
    :Reorder signal phases;
else (No)
    :Keep existing phase order;
endif

:Generate candidate timing plans;

:Evaluate energy-aware cost\nfor each candidate plan;

:Select timing plan with\nminimum total cost;
