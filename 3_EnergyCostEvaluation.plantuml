title EnergyCostEvaluation - Energy-Aware Cost Assessment

start

:Receive candidate timing plan;
:Receive current timing plan;

:Estimate idle time cost;
:Estimate stop-start energy cost;
:Estimate signal switching cost;
:Estimate delay penalty;

:Compute total energy-aware cost\nfor current timing;
:Compute total energy-aware cost\nfor candidate timing;

if (Candidate cost < Current cost?) then (Yes)
    :Accept optimized timing plan;
    stop
else (No)
    :Reject optimized timing plan;
    :Maintain current signal timing;
    stop
